## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get PlantBuddy up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* **Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher**
* **MySQL Database Server**
* **Maven** (Highly Recommended for easy dependency management)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/PlantBuddy.git](https://github.com/your-username/PlantBuddy.git)
    cd PlantBuddy
    ```

    *(Remember to replace `your-username` with the actual GitHub username where your project is hosted.)*

2.  **Database Configuration:**

    * Create a new MySQL database for PlantBuddy (e.g., `plantbuddy_db`).
    * Import the database schema by running the SQL script located at `src/main/resources/database/schema.sql` (or similar path in your project structure) into your new MySQL database.
    * Update the database connection properties in `src/main/resources/application.properties` (or your equivalent configuration file) with your MySQL credentials (username, password, database name).

3.  **Build and Run:**

    * **Using Maven (Recommended):**
        ```bash
        mvn clean install
        mvn javafx:run
        ```
    * **Without Maven:**
        You'll need to manually compile your JavaFX application and include all necessary dependencies (JavaFX modules, MySQL JDBC driver). This method is more complex and depends on your specific IDE setup.
